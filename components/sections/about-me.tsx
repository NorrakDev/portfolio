            Curious about me? Here you have it:
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            I&apos;m a passionate, developer with a focus on full stack
            development. primarily specializing in front-end technologies such
            as React.js, Vue.js, Angular.js, and more. I am enthusiastic about
            bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products to
            life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and writing clear,
            readable, highly performant code matters to me.

          <Typography>
            I began my journey as a web developer in 2021, and since then,
            I&apos;ve continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new
            challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way. Now
            in my mid-twenties, 3 years after starting my web development
            journey, I&apos;m building cutting-edge web applications using
            modern technologies such as Nuxt.js, Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs,
            Angular, Tailwindcss and much more.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            In addition to my development skills, I have a keen interest in web
            scraping, allowing me to gather and analyze data efficiently for
            various purposes.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            I approach projects holistically, from ideation to development, as
            I&apos;m a progressive thinker who enjoys the end-to-end process of
            product creation.
